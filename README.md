### API's 
I spent a lot of time researching and testing different API's. Some that I found even inspired some of my favorite features on the site that I never imagined I could do. For instance, when I found the Alpha Vantage free API for time series stock prices, I knew I had to try to leverage this to make a line graph. 

#### Intrinio
- Financial Ratios
- News
- Company Info 
#### Alpha Vantage
- Time Series
- Current Price

Remaining goals:
- Add cryptocurrencies
- Add gain/loss color indicator for each stock like I have for the total portfolio
- add a homepage with a general newsfeed, maybe based on specific user's interests
- authentication
- watch lists for stocks that you want to keep an eye on but not yet purchase
- confirmation with total price of purchase
