More About the Project

This was the first time I used React for anything bigger than a single-page application and it was a great learning experience. It is amazing how seamlessly stuff on the page can update and change. I enjoyed playing around with toggling different items being available on the page, like forms and the weather widget. Also, I really like designing with styled-components and want to use them even more efficiently on my next project, and when I refactor this project.
